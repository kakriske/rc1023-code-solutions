## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  Block-level elements affect the flow by taking up the full width and start on new lines. This affects the entire structure of the document.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  Inline elements take up as much room as necessary and do not start on
  new lines. They really don't affect the flow

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
  The width is all of the parent element. The height depends on the content.
- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  Inline elements will only take the width and height needed to cover their content.
